This is a neovim plugin called spear.nvim that works similarly to harpoon2.nvim but stores the files with absolute paths.

It can:
1) store file paths in a file in vim data folder
2) show floating buffer in the middle of the screen to see the contents of this file
3) provide a method to open the file on a particular row of this file (only allow 9 rows)
